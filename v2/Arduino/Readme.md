Please read the notes in the [parent folder](https://github.com/formatc1702/Micro-Word-Clock/tree/master/v2).

The RTClib.cpp and RTClib.h files can be placed into your Arduino sketchbooks's library/ folder for use in other projects as well.

The boards.txt file is useful for burning the bootloader to the ATmega328P, to set the fuses to use the internal 8 MHz crystal. It should be placed into an arbitrarily named subfolder inside the hardware/ folder of your Arduino sketchbook. E.g. hardware/internalosc/boards.txt.

RTClib code by [JeeLabs](http://jeelabs.org) released to the public domain.
