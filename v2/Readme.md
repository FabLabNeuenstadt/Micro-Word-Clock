#Micro Word Clock v2

##Description
A tiny replica of the famous Word Clock, using only an ATmega microcontroller, a DS1307 Real Time Clock and a few passive components to display the time on an 8x8 LED matrix. The letters have been printed onto a transparent sheet and glued over the LEDs to produce a readable time.

##Directory structure
- **Arduino** contains the firmware, including pin definitions for the LED matrix and location of the words in each language.
- **EAGLE** contains the schematic and PCB design files for the proejct, and the Bill of Materials.
- **Graphics** contains the design for the transparency sheet to place over the LED matrix to form the words. Contributions in more languages are welcome!
