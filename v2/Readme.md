#Micro Word Clock v2

##Description
A tiny replica of the famous Word Clock, using only an ATmega microcontroller, a DS1307 Real Time Clock and a few passive components to display the time on an 8x8 LED matrix. The letters have been printed onto a transparent sheet and glued over the LEDs to produce a readable time.
See the YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ko9CeylUTs).

##Directory structure
- **Arduino** contains the firmware, including pin definitions for the LED matrix and location of the words in each language.
- **EAGLE** contains the schematic and PCB design files for the proejct.
- **Graphics** contains the design for the transparency sheet to place over the LED matrix to form the words, designed in Inkscape. Contributions in more languages are welcome!

You will require an In-System Programmer (ISP) to write the firmware onto the microcontroller.

##Contributions
Carl Monk has built [his own version](http://fortoffee.org.uk/2014/12/word-clock-with-a-unicorn/) using a [Unicorn HAT](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat).

[quistoph](https://github.com/qistoph) has made a Dutch layout.

Tanguy Rewers independently came up with an alternative Dutch layout (labeled as dutch2).
